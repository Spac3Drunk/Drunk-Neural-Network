# Drunk-Neural-Network

<p>Langages : C, C++</p>
<p>This is a small project without pretension. The main goal is to do a (maybe) functional library of deep learning, in order to (maybe) get a better understanding of this technology.</p>
<p>Will (maybe) have :</p>
<ul>
  <li> Neurons, link between neurons, weight on those links, ... (these are basics for neural network)</li>
  <li> Possibility to chose the function in neurons such as ReLu, Sigmoid and more</li>
  <li> a backpropagation to make a network "learn"</li>
</ul>
<p> it's possible that the listed features aren't implemented, because the goal of the project is to try to make them.</p>

<p>P.S: the project is named "Drunk-Neural-Network", because since we are just student, any neural network made with this code might behave in quite "special" way.</p>
