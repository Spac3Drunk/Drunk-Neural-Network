# Drunk-Neural-Network

<p>Langages : C, C++</p>
<p>This is a small unoptimised project we motivated ourselves to do! The main goal is to do a (maybe) working library of deep learning, in order to (maybe) get a better understanding of this technology.</p>
<p>Will (maybe) have :</p>
<ul>
  <li> Neurons, link between neurons, weight on those links, ... (basics for a neural network)</li>
  <li> Possibility to chose the "Cost" function such as ReLu, Sigmoid and more</li>
  <li> A backpropagation to make the network "learn"</li>
</ul>
<p> It is highly possible that the listed features aren't finished yet, because the goal of the project is to try to make them. (We sadly won't outperform Google)</p>

<p>P.S: The project is named "Drunk-Neural-Network", because since we just are students, any untrained material learning with this code might behave in quite a "special" way.</p>
